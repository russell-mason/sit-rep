Because Postman doesn't provide an Export feature for WebSocket collections, this outlines a basic example:

1. Create a new WebSocket request and set the URL:
{{websocket-host}}/sitrep/ticket-hub

2. Add a header under the "Headers" section:
Key: Fake-User-Id
Value: john.smith

3. Connect via the "Connect" button

4. Add a protocol initialization message to the "Message" section (The U+001E RS record separator character is required)): 
{"protocol":"json","version":1}

5. Send the message via the "Send" button

As tickets are created or updated, so long as they have an "issuedTo" value of "john.smith", details will automatically appear under the "Response" section.
